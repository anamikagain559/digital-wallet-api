# 💳 Digital Wallet API (MFS Project)

A **secure, modular, role-based backend API** for a digital wallet system (like Bkash or Nagad) built with **Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB**. Users can register, manage wallets, and perform financial operations like add money, withdraw, and send money.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

- JWT-based login system with **three roles**: admin, user, agent
- Secure password hashing (bcrypt)
- Automatic wallet creation for each user and agent (initial balance: ৳50)
- Role-based access control
- Full transaction tracking and wallet management

### Features per Role

**Users:**

- Add money (top-up)
- Withdraw money
- Send money to other users
- View transaction history

**Agents:**

- Add money to any user's wallet (cash-in)
- Withdraw money from any user's wallet (cash-out)
- View commission history (optional)

**Admins:**

- View all users, agents, wallets, and transactions
- Block/unblock wallets
- Approve/suspend agents
- Set system parameters (optional)

---

## 🧠 Design Considerations

- **Wallet Management:** Automatically during registration; blocked wallets cannot perform operations.
- **Transaction Management:** Tracks type, amount, fee, commission, initiator, status (pending → completed → reversed), atomic operations.
- **Role Representation:** Single User model with `role` field.
- **Validations & Business Rules:** Insufficient balance, blocked wallets, negative amounts, and non-existent receivers.
- **API Design:** RESTful endpoints like `/wallets/deposit`, `/transactions/me`, `/wallets/block/:id`.
